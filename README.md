Usually I'd squash/tidy my commits prior to a PR but thought it more insightful to leave it as is.

Work completed sporadically between other commitments (total time ~3-4 hours), have at it! :)

To run the test suite, simply clone the repo and `bundle && rake`

Improvement ideas:

* Inline pagination of phone charges (too many rows/lose context of final charge vs table headings)
* Complete PDF rendering
